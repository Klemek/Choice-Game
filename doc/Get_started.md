# Get Started
## Requirements
You will obviously need a Java Runtime Environnement to run the game ([here to get one](https://www.java.com/download/)) and an archive manager (like WinRAR).
## 1. Download code from the repository
You need the base code to work. To do so, you should either build it yourself with gradle or download a build for your operating system from the [builds folder](https://github.com/kalioz/Choice-Game/tree/master/builds). At the end, you have a .jar file that can run and you can play the given demo in it.
## 2. Create your maps
To create your map you will need [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) a free map editor wich will generate the good map format for this software. Maps will be created in two steps :

* Create the main look of the map : read [Creating the map](Map_creation.md#map-creation)
* Create scripts/events that will be your main story : read [Events](Events.md#events)

## 3. Build the game with your story
The final step is to load every resources you have into the game and configure it. You will need to :

* Create the configuration file : read [The Configuration File](Config.md#the-configuration-file)
* Load ressources into the game : read [Build the Game](Build.md#build-the-game)

## 4. That's it
Now you can freely send it to others for them to play your game.
